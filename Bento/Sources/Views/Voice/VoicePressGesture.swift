/// Single-finger press-and-hold recognizer for SpeakTerm's primary voice input.
///
/// Why a custom recognizer instead of `UILongPressGestureRecognizer`:
/// - We need a precise hold threshold (180ms) that is shorter than SwiftTerm's
///   selection long-press, so we win cleanly via `shouldRequireFailureOf` on
///   any real hold.
/// - We need to fail fast on quick taps and on early movement, so SwiftTerm's
///   tap-to-position-cursor and any flick gestures keep working untouched.
/// - We want one recognizer that owns the full press → drag → release lifecycle
///   so direction tracking in `.changed` is unambiguous.
///
/// Coexistence policy is enforced by `TerminalContainerVC` as the delegate:
/// SwiftTerm's selection long-press requires THIS gesture to fail before it
/// can activate. In practice, since we commit at 180ms and SwiftTerm's at
/// ~500ms, we always win on a sustained hold — by design.
